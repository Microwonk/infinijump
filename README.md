# Infinijump
A demo project for using noise and other various algorithms for procedural generation of 2d platformers.

## Future
With the help of these papers ([1](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1265466/FULLTEXT01.pdf), [2](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~pmawhorter/research/papers/procedural_level_generation_using_occupancy_regulated_extension-Mawhorter_Mateas-2010.pdf)) to create an algorithm that can generate infinitely procedural 2d levels from either a WFC (Wave Function Collapse) image or from seeds.
